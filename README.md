A library for making toml betterer.

Usage
-------------
Usage docs to follow.


Compatibility
-------------

This is intended to be a [v0.4.0](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/blob/master/versions/en/toml-v0.4.0.md)
compatible parser.


TODO
-------------
 * inline table support
 * pretty printing of Toml documents
 * roundtrip tests on pretty printer
 * include BurntSushi suite of toml documents
 * whitespace preserving
 * Fixup top level import and haddocks (top level haddock documentation needs explicit exports)

STATUS
-------------

Unfinished, unmaintained and likely superseeded by [tomland](https://github.com/kowainik/tomland).
Most everything I wanted to do with this library has been done in `tomland` either better or sooner that I could have.
